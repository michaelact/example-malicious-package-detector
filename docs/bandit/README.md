# Bandit Guide

Bandit is a powerful tool used for code analysis to identify weak lines of code that may pose security concerns. It is particularly useful for detecting potential vulnerabilities rather than analyzing malicious code. Bandit is the most popular tool of its kind and can be integrated into a continuous integration (CI) tool.

## Testing Environment

The following testing environment was used:

| **Type**         | **Version**                  |
|------------------|------------------------------|
| Operating System | Debian GNU/Linux 10 (buster) |
| Python           |                        3.7.3 |

## Installation and Analysis Steps

To run the Bandit analysis, follow these steps:

1. Install Python virtualenv by running the command: `apt-get install python3-venv`
2. Create a virtual environment named "bandit-env" using the command: `python3 -m venv bandit-env`
3. Activate the virtual environment by running: `source bandit-env/bin/activate`
4. Navigate to the "codebase" directory using: `cd /path/to/example-malicious-package-detector/codebase/`
5. Install the Bandit packages by executing: `pip3 install bandit`
6. Run the analysis using the command: `bandit -r Senginta.py/`

By following these steps, you will be able to set up the Bandit tool, create a virtual environment, and run the analysis on your codebase efficiently.
